# Schema_Creator

###  an application that parses information from uploaded documents into data entities, interactions, and relationships, and then allows for the creation of a detailed schema or dataset based on user input,

## 1. Preprocessing Module
### Document Ingestion: Support for various document formats (PDF, DOCX, images, etc.). This may involve converting all documents into a uniform format for easier processing.
### OCR (Optical Character Recognition): If dealing with scanned documents or images, you'll need an OCR component to extract text. Tools like Tesseract or commercial APIs can be used.
### Text Cleaning: Normalize the text by removing noise, correcting typos, and standardizing formats to ensure consistency in processing.

## 2. Natural Language Processing Module
### Entity Recognition: Use Named Entity Recognition (NER) models to identify and classify entities within the text into predefined categories (e.g., person names, organizations, dates, etc.).
### Relationship Extraction: Apply relationship extraction techniques to identify how entities are related to each other within the document.
### Interaction Analysis: Depending on the complexity, this might involve parsing sentences to understand the actions or verbs that connect entities, possibly using dependency parsing.

## 3. User Interaction Module
### Question-Answering System: Implement a system to interact with the user, asking specific questions about the document content or clarifications on how to classify ambiguous entities or relationships.
### Feedback Loop: Incorporate user feedback to refine entity classifications, relationships, and dataset schema. This might involve supervised learning where the model is retrained or fine-tuned based on user input.

## 4. Schema/Dataset Generation Module
### Schema Definition: Based on entities and relationships identified, generate a schema that represents the structure of the data. This could be a database schema, an XML schema, etc.
### Dataset Construction: Populate the schema with the extracted entities and their relationships, creating a structured dataset from the unstructured text.

## 5. Machine Learning Pipeline Integration
### Model Training and Updating: Integrate ML models for NER, relationship extraction, and interaction analysis that can be trained and updated over time as more documents are processed and more user feedback is collected.
### Automated Pipeline: Ensure the pipeline can automatically process documents, with checkpoints for user input where automation is insufficient.

## 6. User Interface
### Document Upload and Review Interface: A user-friendly interface for document upload, review of extracted information, and input of answers to questions.
### Visualization Tools: Tools for users to visualize entities, their relationships, and the overall schema/dataset in an intuitive way.

## 7. Infrastructure and Scaling
### Cloud Computing: Consider using cloud services for scalability, especially for processing large documents or handling high volumes of documents.
### Data Storage: Secure and scalable storage solutions for both the raw documents and the generated datasets.
### Technologies and Tools
### NLP Libraries: spaCy, NLTK, or transformers for entity recognition and relationship extraction.
### OCR Tools: Tesseract, Google Cloud Vision API, or AWS Textract.
### ML Frameworks: TensorFlow, PyTorch for custom model development.
### Web Frameworks: Flask or Django for building the user interaction module and API endpoints.

----------------------------

### For an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) focusing on basic upload and extraction features, you'll want to streamline the pipeline to include only the core components necessary to demonstrate value to your users while minimizing complexity. Here's a simplified pipeline focused on these essential stages:

## 1. Document Upload and Preprocessing
### Document Upload Interface: Create a simple user interface that allows users to upload documents. Support for common formats like PDF, DOCX, and images should be sufficient at this stage.
### OCR (Optical Character Recognition): If your MVP will handle scanned documents or images, integrate an OCR component to extract text. Tesseract is a popular open-source tool, but you might also consider cloud services like Google Cloud Vision API for better accuracy with less setup.

## 2. Basic Text Extraction and Processing
### Text Normalization: Implement basic text cleaning techniques to prepare the text for processing. This includes converting all text to a consistent case, removing special characters, and possibly correcting common misspellings.
### Named Entity Recognition (NER): Use an existing NLP library to identify and extract entities from the text. Libraries like spaCy or NLTK come with pre-trained models for NER and can identify entities such as names, organizations, dates, etc.

## 3. Simple Entity Review Interface
### Entity Review and Editing: Develop a basic interface where users can see the extracted entities and make corrections or confirmations. This step is crucial for understanding how well your entity extraction is working and for gathering early feedback from users.

## 4. Basic Dataset Generation
### Entity Storage: Store the extracted entities in a structured format, such as a simple database or even a spreadsheet, to demonstrate the transition from unstructured text to structured data.
### Simple Schema Visualization: If possible, provide a basic visualization or summary of the entities extracted from documents to give users an insight into the data captured.

### Technology Stack Suggestions:
### OCR: Tesseract for images and PDFMiner or PyMuPDF for PDFs containing text.
### NLP Library: spaCy for robust NER capabilities out of the box.
### Web Framework: Flask or Django for building the document upload and review interface. Flask is particularly well-suited for MVPs due to its simplicity and flexibility.
### Frontend: HTML/CSS with JavaScript or a simple framework like Bootstrap for the UI. Consider Vue.js or React if you expect the interface to become more interactive in future iterations.
### Database: SQLite for local development and prototyping; it's lightweight and easy to set up. For cloud-based applications, consider PostgreSQL or MongoDB based on your preference for SQL or NoSQL.

### MVP Development Focus:
### Functionality over Form: Ensure that the core features work well before investing in complex UI/UX.
### User Feedback: Design the MVP to collect user feedback effectively. This could be as simple as a feedback form or direct email links.
### Iterative Improvement: Use feedback and observed usage patterns to prioritize development efforts post-MVP launch.

### By focusing on these components, you can build a streamlined MVP that demonstrates the core value proposition of your applicationâ€”turning unstructured document text into structured, actionable data.
